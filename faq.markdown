Disclaimer: This page is intended to provide "simple" answers to common
questions. In most cases the "official" answer can be found in the [Codes,
Covenants, and Restrictions](../assets/documents/combined_ccrs.pdf) or the [HOA
Bylaws](../assets/documents/hoa_bylaws.pdf). If you are seeking legal answers,
consult those official documents. The official documents supercede any
information provided here (please let the Board know about the error so it can
be corrected).

## How do I file a formal complaint?

Complete the [Homeowner Grievance Form](https://str.eunify.net/DocumentDisplay2.asp?durl=DocumentList2.asp&pkid=581413&Community=29446&rec=Y)
and submit it according to the instructions in the form.

However, you should really consider this a last resort. These reports are *not*
anonymous or confidential. The homeowners in Starr Ridge generally want to be
good neighbors, so often it's better to be direct. I think most of us would
rather have a friendly conversation with a neighbor than get a threatening
letter from the HOA.

If that doesn't work, or you're uncomfortable approaching someone directly,
reach out to the Board *informally* to see if they can help. Depending on the
issue, they may ask you to file the grievance form or there may be something
they can do off-the-record.

## Where can homeowners or visitors park?

This is covered in the official [Parking Rules](https://str.eunify.net/DocumentDisplay2.asp?durl=DocumentList2.asp&pkid=583361&Community=29446&rec=Y).

In summary, in most cases overnight parking anywhere other than a paved
driveway or approved driveway extension is prohibited. Disabled vehicles
and vehicles without valid tags must be kept in enclosed garages. RVs can
only be brought into the community for loading and unloading unless the
home has a dedicated RV garage.

## What approvals do I need to change the appearance of my home or yard?

Generally you will need to submit an [Architectural Approval Form](https://str.eunify.net/DocumentDisplay2.asp?durl=DocumentList2.asp&pkid=651857&Community=29446&rec=Y)

Most changes to the appearance of your home (including color changes) will
need approval. Back yard landscaping may or may not require approval
(depending on whether your wall/fencing makes it visible). When in doubt
submit a request. That way you have an official record of the approval
(or statement that approval is not required).

## What is the "Lift Station"?

The Lift Station is a set of pumps needded to lift sewage from the community
past an obstruction and into the county's main sewage line. The Lift Station is
housed in a small structure located at the end of Golden Range Drive. It is
owned by Starr Ridge (not Pima County) and we are entirely responsible for its
operation and maintenance. The associated cost makes it a frequent topic of
discussion at board and member meetings.
