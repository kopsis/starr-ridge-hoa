Board meetings are currently conducted using the Zoom teleconferencing
system. This eliminates the need to obtain a physical meeting room and
makes it possible for traveling and seasonal residents to participate
from any location.

Zoom is a proven mature system used by a vast number of organization.
Major corporations and even the US Government use Zoom for teleconference
meetings. The system is easy to use, but can be confusing to those who
haven't been exposed to it through their employment. Here are some tips
for getting started and links to places you can find more extensive
tutorials.

There are two ways to participate in a Zoom meeting:

1. [Participate by Phone](#participate-by-phone-call)
2. [Participate by App](#participate-by-app)

## Participate by Phone Call

Though Zoom offers a full-featured software application, you don't have
to use it. You can participate in a Zoom meeting by just making a phone
call. You won't have access to video or media display, but you can
listen to the meeting and speak to all the participants.

To join by phone you need three things from the meeting notice (see below):

* Phone number
* Meeting ID
* Passcode

Follow these steps to dial into the meeting:

1. Dial the number and an automated attendant will answer.
2. When the attendant asks for your Meeting ID, use your keypad to enter the Meeting ID from the meeting notice then press the "#" key. Meeting ID can change from meeting to meeting, so make sure you are using the correct one.
3. If the meeting has not started yet, you may be asked to enter your host key if you are the host. Press the "#" key to wait for the host to start the meeting.
4. When the attendant asks for your Participant ID, just press the "#" key. You will be listed in the online meeting by your phone number.
5. When the attendant asks for your Passcode, use your keypad to enter the Passcode from the meeting notice then press the "#" key.

You will then be joined to the meeting. You will hear the audio for the
currently speaking participant.

### Muting and Unmuting

A conference call with lots of participants needs to be managed to keep it fair
and productive. In our meetings an operator controls who is allowed to speak at
any given time. You will need to use your phone keypad to get the operator's
attention.

*Raise Hand*: Press *\*9* on your phone's keypad

This lets the operator (and all video participants) know that you would like to
speak. When it's your turn the operator will unmute you in the Zoom system and
they will announce that you have the floor. You may begin speaking and everyone
should be able to hear you.

Note that you may need to make sure you are not muted on the phone itself. This
is the infamous Zoom "double mute" problem and it's so common that experienced
Zoomers often start whatever they're about to say with "can everyone hear me?"
You should never have to use your phone's mute function in a Zoom call. If you
are a homeonwer participant, you will automatically start muted and the
operator will take care of muting/unmuting you. If you do need to control this
yourself, use *\*6* to have the Zoom system do the muting/unmuting instead of
your phone. The operator can see your *\*6* status and can help turn it on/off.

### Meeting Notices

When a meeting notice is sent or posted, it will look something like this:

the list.

## Participate by App

There are three ways to use all the features of the Zoom teleconferencing
system:

1. Mobile device Zoom app
2. Desktop Zoom app
3. Zoom web app

The mobile device app is the easiest to install and use and is a great
choice for most homeowners. It is available for Apple (iOS) and Android
smartphones and tablets. You can find and install it through your device's
app store - just search for "Zoom".

The desktop/laptop app is available for [Windows](https://zoom.us/download?os=win),
[Mac](https://zoom.us/download?os=mac), and
[Linux](https://zoom.us/download?os=linux). It is ideal for meetings where you
need advanced features like screen and document sharing. Use one of the links
above to download the installer for your system, then run it an follow the
instructions.

The web app is a convenient way to use Zoom on a desktop/laptop without
installing additional software. It has almost all the features of the full app,
but on some systems it can be tricky to get working. If you want to use the web
app, make sure you have a fully updated Windows 10, Windows 11, or MacOS
computer with the latest version of Google Chrome (Windows) or Safari (MacOS)
installed.

Once installed, all the apps work basically the same way. There's no shortage
of tutorials and instructions on the internet, so we'll just provide some
links here:

## Testing

If you want to test that your Zoom app is installed and working correctly, you
can connect to a "test meeting" provided by Zoom. Go to the [Zoom Test
Meeting](https://zoom.us/test) page in your web browser and click the *Join*
button. The test meeting should open automatically in your Zoom app.
