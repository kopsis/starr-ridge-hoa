The management company hired by the Starr Ridge HOA provides a website that is
access restricted to only registered homeowners. That website is used for
information that is best kept within the community. Such information includes
legal stuff like Bylaws and CC&Rs, financial information, request forms, etc.

For simplicity, we'll refer the the management company's website as *eUnify*.
The same software is used for all the communities they manage. The HOA has no
control over the eUnify website. In many cases, even the management company can
do little more than submit a support request to the IT team that actually runs
the site. If you have problems or need technical assistance, first check the
[eUnify Knowledge Base](https://eunifyportal.freshdesk.com/support/solutions).
If that doesn't help, contact Mission Management. As a last resort, you can
reach out to a Board member, but our ability to offer technical help is very
limited.

### Registration

Before you can access eUnify, you will need to register for access. Go to
the [Starr Ridge eUnify Page][str-eunify] and you'll see a "login" form. Click the
*Initial Login* link at the bottom of the form.

You will be presented with the following page.

![Initial Login Form](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_02.png)

Your *Account Number* can be found on your most recent Starr Ridge quarterly
fee invoice. Your name or address should also match what's shown on your
invoice. Make sure to use a current/valid email address since your login info
will be sent to that address. The management company will only use this address
for emails related to your account and email "blasts" authorized by the Board
of Directors. You should not get other unsolicited emails from the management
company (if that happens, let the Board know).

Complete all the form fields and click the green *Get Initial Login Info*
button. The management company will review your information and send login
details to the email address you specified in the form. Allow at least one
business day for this process.

Note that the email will likely come from *eunify@missionmanagement.biz*. Many
email systems (including GMail) tend to think these emails are "spam". If you
haven't seen your login email after a couple of business days, be sure to check
your "spam" folder.

### Navigating

Once you have your initial login information, enter it on the [Starr Ridge
eUnify Page][str-eunify] login form, click the *Remember Me* checkbox, then click the
*Login Now* button.

You should be asked to change your password (sorry, we don't have a copy of
that screen). Simply follow the instructions on the page. Chose a strong
password and write it down so you don't loose it. By the time you need to
login again, it is very easy to foget the password you chose.

With the registration and login dance behind you, the system will show you
something similar to the following screen. It may look a little different in
different web browsers (particularly if you're on a smartphone). Also, some
of the menu items are restricted to members of the Board or Committies -- don't
be concerned if you don't see them.

On this home page you can see your account details including payment information,
violations, ARC requests, and more. We won't walk through all these features
but they're pretty easy to figure out.

Scroll down (it may not be obvious in your browser that there's more stuff on
this page) and you'll see the *Announcements* section.

We haven't been very consistent about using the Announcments feature, and
the new site (the one you're reading now) might make it redundant. Feel free
to let the Board know which site you'd rather use to see announcements.

The (currently) most important feature of eUnify is the Documents section.
Click *Documents* in the red sidebar menu and you'll see something similar
to the following:

![Documents Page](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_06.png)

Documents are organized into folders. To see the foler list, click the
"+" next to the *Main* folder (called out in the picture above). The folder
list will expand as follows:

![Documents Page - expanded folders](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_07.png)

We're getting closer to something useful. You can click on a folder name to
see just the documents in that folder which is probably the easiest way to
find things. There is a *Search* function but it only searches document titles
so you need a pretty good idea of what you're looking for to use it.

Another trick is to click on the column header labeled *Updated*. This will
sort the document list by date updated. A small arrow will appear next to the
*Updated* label. If the arrow points down, the list is sorted with newest
documents at the top. If the arrow points up, the list is sorted with oldest
documents at the top. Click the *Updated* column header again to toggle the
sort direction.

If you're looking for a recent document, this sort feature will make it
pretty easy to find. If you're looking for something older, you may have
to dig a bit. Be sure to check the Handbook on this site for shortcuts.
The Handbook sections have direct links to many of the more commonly
needed documents.
