Marcia and David met with Fernando, our landscaping contractor's new operations
manager on Friday. We drove around the neighborhood discussing the contract
tasks. He has a thorough understanding of what is required under the contract.
He suggested dividing the subdivision into two parts. The crew would work each
area on different days allowing them to be a little more focused. He stated
that it would be at no additional cost. They work in this area frequently, so
it won't adversely affect their schedule. We asked him to capture any other
suggestions for getting the most benefit out of the current budget. He is going
to send a proposal for the board to review.
