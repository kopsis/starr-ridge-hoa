Mission Management (the management company hired by the Starr Ridge HOA)
provides a website that is access restricted to only registered homeowners.
That website is used for your personal property and payment portal, as well as
information that is best kept within the community. Such information includes
legal stuff like Bylaws and CC&Rs, financial information, request forms, etc.

For simplicity, we'll refer the the management company's website as *eUnify*.
The same software is used for all the communities they manage. The Board has no
control over the eUnify website. In many cases, even the management company can
do little more than submit a support request to the IT team that actually runs
the site. If you have problems or need technical assistance, first check the
[eUnify Knowledge Base](https://eunifyportal.freshdesk.com/support/solutions).
If that doesn't help, contact Mission Management. As a last resort, you can
reach out to a Board member, but our ability to offer technical help is very
limited.

### Mobile

There is a mobile app called *Community Link* that should provide most of the
same features as the website. It can be downloaded from the Apple or Google
Play app stores. You can also access the regular website through the browser on
your mobile device, but the app may be better suited to the small screen.

For the sake of keeping these "already too-long" instructions from getting
even longer, we will only cover the website. If you would really like to see
instructions for the mobile app, let us know.

### Registration

Before you can access eUnify, you will need to register for access. Go to
the [Starr Ridge eUnify Page][str-eunify] and you'll see a "login" form. Click the
*Initial Login* link at the bottom of the form.

![Login Page](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_01.png)

You will be presented with the following page.

![Initial Login Form](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_02.png)

Your *Account Number* can be found on your most recent Starr Ridge quarterly
fee invoice. Your name or address should also match what's shown on your
invoice. Make sure to use a current/valid email address since your login info
will be sent to that address. The management company will only use this address
for emails related to your account and email "blasts" authorized by the Board
of Directors. You should not get other unsolicited emails from the management
company (if that happens, let the Board know).

Complete all the form fields and click the green *Get Initial Login Info*
button. The management company will review your information and send login
details to the email address you specified in the form. Allow at least one
business day for this process.

Note that the email will likely come from *eunify@missionmanagement.biz*. Many
email systems (including GMail) tend to think these emails are "spam". If you
haven't seen your login email after a couple of business days, be sure to check
your "spam" folder.

Once you have your initial login information, enter it on the [Starr Ridge
eUnify Page][str-eunify] login form, click the *Remember Me* checkbox, then
click the *Login Now* button.

You should be asked to change your password (sorry, we don't have a copy of
that screen). Simply follow the instructions on the page. Chose a strong
password and write it down so you don't loose it. By the time you need to
login again, it is very easy to foget the password you chose.

### Home Page

With the registration and login dance behind you, the system will show you
something similar to the following screen. It may look a little different in
different web browsers (particularly if you're on a smartphone). Also, some
of the menu items are restricted to members of the Board or Committies -- don't
be concerned if you don't see them.

![Screenshot of Main Page](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_03.png)

On this home page you can see your account details including payment
information, violations, ARC requests, and more. We won't walk through all
these features but they're pretty easy to figure out.

Scroll down (it may not be obvious in your browser that there's more stuff on
this page) and you'll see the *Announcements* section.

![Screenshot of Main Page - scrolled](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_04.png)

We haven't been very consistent about using the Announcments feature, and
the new site (the one you're reading now) might make it redundant. Feel free
to let the Board know which site you'd rather use to see announcements.

### Documents

Documents that we want to make available only to homeowners (such as Board
Meeting minutes) can be found in the Documents section. Click *Documents* in
the red sidebar menu and you'll see something similar to the following:

![Documents Page](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_06.png)

Documents are organized into folders. To see the foler list, click the
"+" next to the *Main* folder (called out in the picture above). The folder
list will expand as follows:

![Documents Page - expanded folders](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_07.png)

We're getting closer to something useful. You can click on a folder name to
see just the documents in that folder which is probably the easiest way to
find things. There is a *Search* function but it only searches document titles
so you need a pretty good idea of what you're looking for to use it.

Another trick is to click on the column header labeled *Updated*. This will
sort the document list by date updated. A small arrow will appear next to the
*Updated* label. If the arrow points down, the list is sorted with newest
documents at the top. If the arrow points up, the list is sorted with oldest
documents at the top. Click the *Updated* column header again to toggle the
sort direction.

![Documents Page - sort by Updated](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_08.png)

If you're looking for a recent document, this sort feature will make it
pretty easy to find. If you're looking for something older, you may have
to dig a bit. Be sure to check the Handbook on this site for shortcuts.
The Handbook sections have direct links to many of the more commonly
needed documents.

### Property Info

You can view your personal property information in the Property Info section.
This includes viewing violations, architectural requests, paying your
assessments, and viewing account ledgers and billing statements. Click
*Property Info* in the red sidebar menu and you'll get a screen similar to the
one on the home page. At the bottom of the *View Account* section of the page
you will see something similar to the following image with buttons for making a
payment as well as buttons for viewing additional info like violations and
architecture requests.

![Property Info Page Excerpt](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_prop_info.png)

To make a one time payment or set up an automatic payment, click the green *Pay
Now* button. You will see a page similar to the following:

![Pay Now Form](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_pay_now.png)

To proceed with a one-time payment, click the blue *Continue* button. To set up
or manage an autopay, click *Auto Pay* tab at the top. The following screen
will show your autopay status:

![AutoPay Status](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_autopay.png)

To proceed with a one-time payment, click the blue *Continue* button. To set up
Click the blue *Setup AutoPay* to proceed with setup. You will get a form
similar to the following:

![AutoPay Status](/assets/eunify/str_eunify_autopay_2.png)

You can add a payment method by clicking “Send Payments From”.

* Please note that using a Credit/Debit card will add a processing fee. This fee
  goes entirely to the payment processor -- none of it goes to Mission Management
  or the HOA.
* Choosing the eCheck option will have no additional fees.

Starr Ridge dues are quarterly, so select *Quarterly* in the *Frequency* drop-down.

* Quarterly autopay will be charged the first week of Jan, April, July, and Oct.

It is generally best to select *Pay the full amount* since that will
automatically adjust your payment if there are any dues increases or fines. If
you select *Pay a fixed amount*, it is your responsibility to update your
autopay any time there is an increase in the amount due. You can choose the
middle option (*Pay the full amount up to a maximum of*) if you want to allow
for some increase but not automatically cover a large increase such as might
happen in the event of a Special Assessment.

### My Profile

You can view and change your personal information by clicking *My Profile* in the
red sidebar menu. Here you can set/change your mailing address, email, phone number,
login password, notification preferences, etc. Most of the settings here are
pretty self-explanatory.
