## What is the Lift Station?

The Lift station is a set of pumps that lift sewage from the main neighborhood sewer line over an obstruction to get it into the Pima County sewer main that runs down Sarasota Blvd. It is located in a small structure at the south end of Golden Range. The Lift Station operates 24/7 and without it all the neighborhood sewer lines would back up. To ensure reliable operation, it has a natural gas powered backup electric generator and an electronic monitoring system.

The HOA is 100% responsible for the operation and maintenance of the Lift Station. We pay for the electic service to operate it, the gas service for the backup, and the communication service for monitoring. Maintenance includes replacing the pumps when they are damaged or wear out, servicing the backup generator, maintenance on the structure itself, and any other associated costs.

## Why doesn't Pima County own/operate the Lift Station?

The decision to have the community own the Lift Station was made by the original Starr Ridge developer before homesite development started. The HOA has looked into transferring ownership/operation to Pima County, but the station does not meet current design standards. Upgrading the station to meet those standards is estimated to cost on the order of $200,000. The Board of Directors has decided that continued HOA ownership/operation is the best course of action for the near-term. The matter is generally revisited prior to any major maintenance outlays.
